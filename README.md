# Gratitude-Journal-BackEnd

=======
## Description
This is the backend for the Gratitude Journal App. It hosts APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to a MongoDB database.

## Motivation
This project was born out of a desire to test and demonstrate my understanding of 
the software development cycle. I'm planning to integrate an API for positive quotes that will be sent to the front end.

## Technologies Used
This project is built with the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## Features
Here are the key features of this project:

1. **CRUD Operations**: The app provides APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting journal entries in a MongoDB database.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/bonolo2s/Gratitude-Journal-BackEnd.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd projectname`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `node app.js`

## Usage
Once the server runs, you can interact with the APIs using any HTTP client like curl, Postman, or even your browser.
